* After review at the end as I had time to check a great tools called contrast grid. I ended up removing the rgb(0,130,200) which made for better viewing experience. and finish with just using 3 colors. This also bought my SEO score in lighthouse to 100.

### Images

## Testing 

## Functionality testing 

 I used Chrome web developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.
 
Lighthouse was key for optimising the website. 


## Compatibility testing
 The Site was tested across 21 virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices in both Mozilla web developer tolls and Chrome developer tools. 
 
 I tested on hardware devices such as: Macbook pro 13", mac desktop 27", iphone 5, Samsaung ds, Mac tablet, and all screen width as follows:
 * 2560px, 1920px 1900px, 1680px, 1600px, 1500px, 1440px, 1280px, 1200px, 1115px, 1024px, 950px, 820px, 768px, 540px, 460px, 425px, 414px, 390px, 375px, 320px.
 * But Found it was not responsive, I learned a very valuable lesson and one that took serval hours to get right. It is now responsive and I checked it on all the above after solving the bugs.

## Issues found during site development

### Hero pics 
* I used a Youtube video to get the desired outcome with balancing the main hero photo with the 2 smaller ones and a trick I picked up at a slack study group.

### Left and right abouts 
As I wanted to look designed rather than inline.
* This was troublesome to say the least, but I am now very good with margin, border and padding. It took a lot of work during resizing and it will be a lot faster next time.

* #### Sizing on the Horizontal scrolling bar on the bottom of the screen.
    * I used the developer tools in Chrome to resize and fix.


* #### I had to create several screen sizes to keep the look of the website.
   * This was time consuming and will approach in a different way the next, and the amount I learned getting through it was colossal.



## Performance testing

I ran [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check the performance of the website.
I had to do a couple of changes to improve performance. Screenshots are presented below:

![Screen Shot 2022-02-09 at 08 14 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96495354/153283959-dc7d2514-f151-4743-bb65-efe6f13f5a25.png)

### I had major images issues at the first lighthouse run
   * I fixed these with a great toll https://picresize.com/ This save my project because I had a lot of images and I was able to reduce them in size in group which was brilliant.
![Screen Shot 2022-02-07 at 18 06 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96495354/153283949-e5b734f6-ca19-416e-bba4-e6ee2d7ad7bd.png)

### I have better luck after fixing that. but the next bugs was a change in 2 more resizing of pictures
![Screen Shot 2022-02-09 at 13 22 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96495354/153283944-4ec99a89-53dc-4a04-8608-000d5f2e9ea0.png)

### Performance was good, now I just need to fix a bug on an information anchor element that had no description.



### Final results:

I noticed that these test scores vary from time to time and depend on external libraries as well.

## Code Validation
 At the and of the project I used two websites to validate a code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
