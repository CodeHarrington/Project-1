## Issues found during site development

### Hero pics 
* I used a youtube video to get the desired outcome with balancing the main hero photo with the 2 smaller ones.

### Left and right abouts 
As I wanted to look designed rather than inline.
* This was troublesome to say the least, but I am now very good with margin, border and padding. it took alot of work during resizing and it will be alot faster next time.

* #### Sizing on the Horizontal scrolling bar on the bottom of the screen.
    * I used the developer tools in Chrome to resize and fix.


* #### I had to create several screen sizes to keep the look of the website.



## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check the performance of the website.
I had to do a couple of changes to improve performance. Screenshots are presented below:

![Screen Shot 2022-02-09 at 08 14 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96495354/153283959-dc7d2514-f151-4743-bb65-efe6f13f5a25.png)

### I had major images issues at the first lighthouse run
   * I fixed these with a great toll https://picresize.com/ This save my project because I had alot of images and I was able to reduce them in size in group which was brillant.
![Screen Shot 2022-02-07 at 18 06 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96495354/153283949-e5b734f6-ca19-416e-bba4-e6ee2d7ad7bd.png)

### I have better luck after fixing that. but the next bugs was a change in 2 more resizing of pictures
![Screen Shot 2022-02-09 at 13 22 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96495354/153283944-4ec99a89-53dc-4a04-8608-000d5f2e9ea0.png)

### Performance was good, now I just need to fix a bug on an information anchor element that had no description.



### Final results:

I noticed that these test scores vary from time to time and depend on external libraries as well.

## Code Validation
 At the and of the project I used two websites to validate a code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
